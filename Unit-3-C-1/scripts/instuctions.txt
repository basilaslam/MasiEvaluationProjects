Problem Statement :-
Being a responsible developer at Puma, your task is to create an admin panel for the marketing team, where they can add, remove and update their products data.

Description :-
Create an admin panel (index.html), which will have a form to accept data.
Form will have the following fields :-
Type
Description
Price
Image URL
Use local storage as your database.
Each product should be stored in an array and this array will be stored in local storage.
Provide a “Add Product” button to add the data to local storage.
Create a “Show Products” button at the top which will redirect you to “inventory.html”
Create a product display page (inventory.html), Where all the products stored in the local storage will be displayed.
Each new product data should get appended next to each other in grid format.
Each product should have a “Remove” button as a part of its HTML.
On clicking on remove, the product should be removed from the DOM as well as the local storage.
Add a “Add More Product” button at the top which will redirect you to index.html.
Note :-
Use better ways to create objects that we learnt. Comment each line of code in your own words. Complete the functionality first before investing heavily into design.

Things to follow :-
The “Show product” button will have id - “show_products”.
Give the form id :- “products”.
The input fields will have the following IDs :-
Type :- “type”
Description :- “desc”
Price :- “price”
Image :- “image”
The product object will have following keys: -
{
type: "",
desc: "",
price: "",
image: ""
}
The products will be stored in local storage with key “products”.
Add Product button will have an id :- “add_product”.
All the input fields should become empty after submitting the form
Add more product button should have id :- “add_more_product”
Remove product button should have id :- “remove_product”.
Append all products data to div with an id :- "all_products"
